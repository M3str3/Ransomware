# Ransomware 

## üìå Overview
This project simulates a ransomware operation, covering infection, encryption, exfiltration, and centralized control. It includes multiple components:

* **RustLock (Rust ransomware)**: The main ransomware payload, responsible for encrypting user data and exfiltrating it to the relay server over FTP.
* **Server/ClearService (C2 #1 - Relay Server)**: The first-hop server that temporarily stores the encrypted files in waiting to be downloaded for C2#2. The idea behind having a relay server is to be able to exfiltrate data over the clearnet (faster than TOR). It also allows to have a custom configuration like 0 logs or wipe systems in case of logins.
* **Server/HiddenService (C2 #2 - Central Server)**: The main TOR server scans multiple relay servers waiting for a new record, then downloads the data. It also serves a ransomware website via TOR.

# Exfiltration architecture

The ransomware follows this multi-stage attack pattern:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Infected User] 
    R[locker.exe]

    subgraph Victim
         A --> R 
    end

    subgraph C2#1 - Relay Infrastructure
        B[C2#1 - Relay Server]
    end

    subgraph C2#2 - Central Infrastructure
        C[C2#2 - Central Server]
        D[C2#2 - Web Interface ransom blog]
    end
    R -->|"Exfiltrates Encrypted Data over FTP"| B
    B <-->|"Retrieves Data with API KEY"| C;
    C -->|"Feeds"| D;

```


## üîπ Step-by-step Execution Flow:

### 1. Infection (RustLocker)
* locker.exe is executed on the victim‚Äôs machine.
* It scans the filesystem and encrypts all relevant files using AES key that has been generated on execution time.
* It encrypts the Key with a public RSA then encode it in base64.
* It send the encrypted data and key to C2#1 over FTP

### 2. Exfiltration (C2#1)
* The victim encrypted data is sent to C2#1 (Relay Server) over FTP.
* C2#1 generates a unique entry for the data 
* This server has 0 log policy (not really implemented on the example)
* Implements a password to download the encrypted data about the victims

### 3. Ransom Blog Updates (C2#2)
* Periodically, the backend services ask for all the C2#1 (can be multiple) for encrypted data and keys.
* The victim‚Äôs data appears on the ransom blog (hosted by C2#2).
* This server now has the key (AES+RSA) encode in base64 that can use for unencrypt the data

# üîê Encryption Details
## The key cycle looks like
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Ransomware as Ransomware (Infected Machine)
    participant AES as AES-256 Key (Generated)
    participant RSA as RSA-4096 Public Key (Embedded)
    participant C2

    Ransomware->>AES: Generate AES key in memory
    Ransomware->>Ransomware: Encrypt files with AES key
    Ransomware->>RSA: Encrypt AES key using RSA public key
    Ransomware->>C2: Upload encrypted AES key & file metadata
```
* **AES** the key is generated on execution. As its faster than RSA, it is used for encryption.
* **RSA** after encryption, AES key is encrypted with public RSA, so only the person who has the private key can recover the original key.

# üõ°Ô∏è Anti-Analysis & Evasion Techniques
To resist forensic analysis, RustLock implements basic methods like:

* **Environment Checks**: Detects sandboxes, virtual machines, and debuggers.
